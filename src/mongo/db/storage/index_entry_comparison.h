         * (explained momentarily). Either lhs or rhs can represent a bound of a query, meaning that
         * either lhs or rhs can be the result of a call to makeQueryObject(). At most one can be a
         * query object. The comparison function compares the BSONObjects in each IndexKeyEntry, and
         * uses the DiskLoc's as a tiebreaker.
         *
         * Ex: {"": 5, "": "foo"} > {"": 4, "": "foo"}
         *     {"": 5, "": "foo"} < {"": 5, "": "zzz"}
         *
         * It may be necessary to specify the first element of a query object as an inclusive range,
         * the second one as an exclusive range, etc. Always returning 0 when the two BSONObjects
         * have identical values would only allow inclusive ranges across all elements of the query
         * object.
         *
         * To get around this, a query object uses its field names to describe what a given
         * field's behavior should be if it is being compared to a field with an equal value. An 'l'
         * indicates that the query should be considered less than the other object, a 'g' indicates
         * that the query should be considered greater than the other object,and a null byte
         * indicates that the query should be considered equal to the other object.
         *
         * Ex: {"": 5, "": "foo"} == {"": 5, "": "foo"}
         *     {"g": 5, "": "foo"} > {"": 5, "": "foo"}
         *     {"": 5, "l": "foo"} < {"": 5, "": "foo"}
